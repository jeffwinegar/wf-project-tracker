# WF Project Tracker

WF Project Tracker is a web app designed to clearly show a listing of specific
client projects using the Workfront API. Projects can be filtered by project
name search, client breakdown, program, and role. All filters can be used in 
conjunction with each other to refine listing.

Features include:

- Hours scoped vs. hours logged per assigned role in each project
- Remainder hours difference and percentage of hours used per role per project 
  to better track hours as employees log time
- Flags when logged hours have met (displays gray) or exceeded (displays red)
  scoped hours
- Number of days left before project expires
- When using the role filter, listing changes to show all projects assigned to 
  a selected role with additional display of total scoped hours, total logged 
  hours, and total percent complete for that role
