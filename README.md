# WF Project Tracker

WF Project Tracker is a web app designed to clearly show a listing of specific client projects using the Workfront API.

Features include:

- displaying hours scoped vs. hours logged per associated role
- remainder hours difference and percentage of hours used per role to better track hours as employees log time
- flag when logged hours have exceeded scoped hours
- number of days left before project expires

Projects can also be filtered by project name search, client breakdown, program, and role showing a paired down list of projects.
