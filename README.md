# WF Project Tracker

WF Project Tracker is a web app designed to clearly show a listing of specific
client projects using the Workfront API. Projects can be filtered by project
name search, client breakdown, program, and role.

Features include:

- Hours scoped vs. hours logged per assigned role in each project
- Remainder hours difference and percentage of hours used per role to better
  track hours as employees log time
- Flags when logged hours have met (displays gray) or exceeded (displays red)
  scoped hours
- Number of days left before project expires
- When role filter is selected, changes project list to show all projects
  assigned to the selected role
